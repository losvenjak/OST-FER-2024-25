# Development of an LDA Model for Performance Prediction Under Startle Conditions
Seminar Paper – Defense Systems and Technologies

## Project Description

This project investigates the possibility of estimating and predicting pilot performance in a flight simulator under startle conditions using physiological signals:

- EDA (Electrodermal Activity) – skin conductance
- ECG (Electrocardiogram) – cardiac activity
- QRS detection – heartbeat analysis

A Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) model was developed for performance classification.

## Method
- Feature extraction from EDA & ECG
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
- Validation: LOO, LOGO
